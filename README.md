# stockMonitor
About this code:
----------------------------------------
I started learning python at my work and I was very interested to play with data and graph. I believe the all the data's are connected. 
Thus I started building graphs on Stock market to visualized how the prices of company moves using Excel but i found it very quickly that excel is not good. Then I build a small grap on price movement using Python and mathplotylib. The biggest issue with all the graph and charting tool is they are supper complex and I was not sure how they constructed the algorithm at the back. I tried for almost a year with TD waterhouse graph and gave up after realizing that those graphs does not help.

My aim is build a graph that will help everyone to see  what is coming,
